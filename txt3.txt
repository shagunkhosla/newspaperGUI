A Chinese state-controlled tabloid close to the ruling Communist party has refused to carry the Indian embassy’s response to an interview of Pakistani Ambassador where the diplomat repeated Islamabad’s “lies and half-truths” about J&K.

Tweeting about the nationalistic Global Times tabloid refusing to carry the response, the Indian embassy said: “The Global Times @globaltimesnews declined to carry the Indian Embassy’s response to this interview.”
